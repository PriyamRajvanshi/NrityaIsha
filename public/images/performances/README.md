# Performance Images

Place your performance images in this folder (`public/images/performances/`).

## How to add images:

1. Copy your image files to this `public/images/performances/` folder
2. Name them as:
   - `performance1.jpg` (or `.png`)
   - `performance2.jpg`
   - `performance3.jpg`
   - `performance4.jpg`
   - `performance5.jpg`
   - `performance6.jpg`
   - `performance7.jpg`
   - `performance8.jpg`
   - `performance9.jpg`

Or update the image paths in `src/pages/Performances.jsx` to match your filenames.

## Layout:

The images will be displayed in a **3x3 grid layout**:
- **3 rows** × **3 columns** = **9 images total**
- **3 columns** on all screen sizes
- Images are displayed side by side in rows (inspired by houseontheclouds.com)

## Tips:

- Use square or similar aspect ratio images for best results
- Recommended resolution: 1000x1000px or higher
- Images will have a hover effect (zoom and overlay)
- Keep image files optimized for web (under 500KB each recommended)
